/** section: Language
 * class ObjectRange
 *  includes Enumerable
 *
 *  A succession of values.
 *
 *  An `ObjectRange` can model a range of any value that implements a `succ`
 *  method (which links that value to its "successor").
 *
 *  Prototype provides such a method for [[Number]] and [[String]], but you
 *  are (of course) welcome to implement useful semantics in your own objects,
 *  in order to enable ranges based on them.
 *
 *  `ObjectRange` mixes in [[Enumerable]], which makes ranges very versatile.
 *  It takes care, however, to override the default code for `include`, to
 *  achieve better efficiency.
 *
 *  While `ObjectRange` does provide a constructor, the preferred way to obtain
 *  a range is to use the [[$R]] utility function, which is strictly equivalent
 *  (only way more concise to use).

 *  This method is a convenience wrapper around the [[ObjectRange]] constructor,
